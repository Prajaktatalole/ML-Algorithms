Data Science :
Is an interdisciplinary field which uses statistics ,maths,algorithms to extract information
from structured and unstructured data and uses this information for business descision.
 
DS ====> maths ,stats ,Programming ,Domain knowlwdge.

Structured data ===> Tabular format ====>df
Unstructured data ====>File ,Website ,notebook,Text ,Audio ,Video ,Image

Test Audio==>NLP
Image ,Video===>computer vision.


Life cycle :
Credit card Fraud Transaction Detection
1.Business undesrstanding 
2.Data Gathering
collect transaction data :
transaction loc ,trans time ,amount ,reason .
3.Data Preparation 
4.Modeling ====ML step
we will feed the cleaned data to ML algorithm 
It will learn some patterns and dff btween fraud and Genuine
transaction.
So in future ML alg will predict whether the trans is Fraud or Genuine.
5.Evaluation of model.
6.Deployment

Machine learning -study of algorithms that can learn and imporve
from experience using data.


Machine learning is a subset of AI, which enables the machine to 
automatically learn from data, improve performance
 from past experiences, and make predictions

Area of circle. formula
So formula is predefined called as Rule Based system.

bUt when we generate some formula from data is called as ML.

eg.prediction of prize of house.
area no of rooms locality  Prize.

Diff Data Types in ML :
1.Numerical Data /Quantitative data----> cont ,discrete
2.Categorical /Qualititative data.---->nominal ,ordinal.


Give Example : height ,wt ,prize ,area ,volume ---> cont data
               no of students ,no of days yrs of expe ,no of rooms ===> discrete
               gender ,color ,Blood group ,dept ,subjects ==>Nominal
               Grades ,Level in Company ,middle class lower class ===> Ordinal


Types of ML :
Supervised======> Regression ,classification

Reg ===> Target var is continuoues eg. house prize ,stock prize
                                       temp pred .
Classification ===>Target var is categorical eg ,spam ,ham 
                                                  Fraud Transaction
                                                  covid positive/negative


Unsupervised 
Semisupervised
Reinforcement.

===========================================================================

EDA and Preprocessing :
Exploratory Data Analysis :
Step-I
Understanding the data,dtype,visualization ,missing values ,skewed ,
kurtosis ,outliers ,descriptive statistics .

Step2 -Preprecessing :
Outlier removal ,missing value treatment removing skewness kurtosis.
